# Introduction

This is a mobile frontend for the 
[Inventory Database](https://github.com/ahmed-abdrhmn/Inventory-Database)
project that I created a while ago. This application provides a smooth user
interface that uses material design that allows you to perform CRUD operations
on the database.

# Requirements

- Have flutter installed on your machine. [see here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- Install Android Studio on your machine. [see here](https://developer.android.com/studio/install)
- Have your phone paired with your machine or an android emulator installed and running.
  [see here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device)
- The backend should be running in your machine. [see here](https://github.com/ahmed-abdrhmn/Inventory-Database)


# Instructions

After cloning this repository, do the following steps to run this project:

1. Open the project root directory in Android Studio.
2. Create a copy of /lib/config.dart.template in the same directory 
without the .template extension. Then put your machine's local ip address in that file
as instructed there.
3. Press the run button. It takes a while to build but the app 
should be run in your phone or emulator.
